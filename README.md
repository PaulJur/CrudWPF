# What is this WPF application?

This application was made for practice purposes for learning WPF(Windows Presentation Foundation) with .NET and Entity framework using SQL management server for localhost.

This application works by setting your server, database and being able to use CRUD operation on your data for eg. Used for Person data like in the code.
